## Aloha
Aloha and welcome to the official OWASP Hawai'i Chapter!

We are a small chapter of dedicated application developers and security professionals coming together to share knowledge, and through community, build a more resilient technical Hawai'i ecosystem and technical workforce.

If you would like to join and participate in our meetups and events and get plugged into the community, we'd love to have you!

The easiest way is to join our [OWASP Hawai'i Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Hawaii/) where we post all of our meetups and events.
